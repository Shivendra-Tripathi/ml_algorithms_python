# ml_algorithms_python
A growing collection of machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch and with libraries in Python. This repository serves as a personal learning journey and reference guide through the core concepts of ML



This repository documents my progress as I learn and implement machine learning algorithms using Python. It includes:
- Implementations from scratch to understand inner workings
- Library-based implementations 
- Explanatory notebooks, code comments, and references

Feel free to explore, suggest improvements, or contribute!

## ðŸ§  Covered Topics
- Supervised Learning (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees)
- Unsupervised Learning (e.g., K-Means, PCA)
- Neural Networks (coming soon)
- Optimization algorithms
- And more as I progress...
